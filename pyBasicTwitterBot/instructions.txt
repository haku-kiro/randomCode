This is a basic twitter bot that I wrote:

1. Collects a random picture and saves it. 
2. Tweets that image.

3.Every hour, repeats that cycle.


To repeat steps one and two I set up a basic cron job on my rPi.

Those that are interested:
sudo crontab -e
Then add the following line to then end of your jobs:
*/60 * * * * bash /<pathToBashScript>/getImg.sh && python /<pathToPyScript>/pyBot.py 


You'll need to set up your own twitter account with your api keys etc. Also, you have to save the img in the same folder as the python script (Of Course).
